'''
Starts the process of generating the seating.
Right now every algorithm is at least present as a stub.
Current plan is to have a complete random algorithm, a optimized weighted algorithm and
an optimized algorithm with more random elements.

TODO: create simple weighted random algorithm (only constraints) [random_constraint()]

TODO: pretty much everything except complete random

Functions:
